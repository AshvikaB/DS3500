## Description:
Created a bubble chart as part of a Friends tv show episode analysis dashboard. This bubble chart is part of a collaborative group project 
where we created a Friends TV show dashboard featuring NLP and other visualizations. My contribution consisted of data cleaning for text analysis 
and creating an interactive bubble chart through Plotly Dash in Python. 

## The project aims to answer these question: 
What words are our favorite characters using the most?
Do these correspond to their beloved catchphrases or storylines?
What are the overall sentiment scores for these characters across seasons?
How does the sentiment analysis relate to overall episode ratings?

The bubble chart has a slider where the user can select a range of episode ratings (stars) and
episodes that fall within that range appear on the dashboard. The user can also hover over each
bubble and see the summary, episode rating (stars), votes, episode title, duration, and season
number. This way it is easy for the user to search and watch that specific episode. The size of
each bubble is dependent on the rating. The episode ratings seem very evenly dispersed
throughout the season, but a few ratings stand out for the prominent and most iconic episodes
throughout the show. If you are familiar with the show, two very popular ones were when Phoebe
finds out about Monica and Chandler, and of course the series finale.
